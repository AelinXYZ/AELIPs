## Simple Summary

Include Kwenta retroactively for all purposes as contemplated by AELIP-13.
## Abstract

Kwenta pool to be retroactively considered under the same criteria set forth in AELIP-13 with respect to OP rewards.

## Motivation

The Kwenta raise signaled early alignment with Aelin and Optimism. The exchange of vKWENTA for KWENTA remains outstanding. This was a relatively high value raise for Aelin and Aelin is likely to refer to it going forward for marketing purposes.
In addition, the Kwenta raise would likely meet the criteria for distribution of OP rewards pursuant to AELIP-13. The actual distribution pursuant to AELIP-13 and AELIP-24 would present additional marketing events to further drive engagement with Aelin and Optimism much sooner than any other project in the ecosystem at this point.
For the foregoing reasons, it is reasonable to include the Kwenta raise under the AELIP-13 criteria for OP rewards.

In the interests of full disclosure: the author notes that they are a participant in the Kwenta raise/pool; presently serves on the interim council for Kwenta; is an Aelin Mod "Aegis"; and, is currently serving on the Spartan Council at Synthetix.
