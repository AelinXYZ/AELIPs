## Simple Summary

This AELIP proposes to cap the fee that a Sponsor can charge at 15%.

## Abstract

It is important that Aelin pools are legitimate. Setting an upper bound cap on sponsor fees is important, as it ensures that users are not taken advantage of.

## Motivation

Aelin is a trust-less system, and due to that, pools have been made which have set an outrageous 50% sponsor fee on the pool. These pools are obvious scams. To limit this, I propose an upper bound limit of 15% set by the contract and enforced by the UI.

## Specification
