## Simple Summary

Include Kwenta retroactively for all purposes as contemplated by AELIP-13 and AELIP-22.

## Abstract

Kwenta raise/pool to be retroactively considered under the same criteria set forth in AELIP-13 and AELIP 22 with respect to AELIN and OP rewards, respectively.

## Motivation

The Kwenta raise signaled early alignment with Aelin and Optimism. The exchange of vKWENTA for KWENTA remains outstanding. This was a relatively high value raise for Aelin and Aelin is likely to refer to it going forward for marketing purposes.
The Kwenta raise would likely otherwise meet the criteria for distribution of OP rewards pursuant to AELIP-22 and would meet the criteria under AELIP-13.

The actual distribution of AELIN and OP rewards pursuant to AELIP-13 and AELIP-22 would present additional marketing events to further drive engagement with Aelin and Optimism much sooner than any other project in the ecosystem at this point.
For the foregoing reasons, it is reasonable to include the Kwenta raise under the AELIP-13 and AELIP-22.

In the interests of full disclosure: the author notes that they are a participant in the Kwenta raise/pool; presently serves on the interim council for Kwenta; is an Aelin Mod "Aegis"; and, is currently serving on the Spartan Council at Synthetix.
