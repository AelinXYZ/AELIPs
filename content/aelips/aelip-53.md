Dear Aelin community,

It is with a heavy heart that the Aelin Council unanimously proposes the difficult decision for core contributors (CCs) to stop working on the Aelin Protocol.

Over the past months and years, the Aelin CCs and Council have worked tirelessly to build Aelin into a promising DeFi protocol. Despite our best efforts and the dedication of all the CCs, we must acknowledge that Aelin did not gain the level of traction we had hoped for.

Amongst other things, the bear market, coupled with low usage of the protocol, has not given Aelin the necessary momentum to sustain the protocol. Given these circumstances, the members of the Aelin council have each determined that it is in everyone's best interest to stop working on the project and propose to return as much value as possible to AELIN holders via a treasury distribution.

Effective August 7, 2023, all operations on the protocol from the core contributors will cease, but the front-end is expected to remain online until October 15, 2023. While no new pools may be created via the current Aelin front-end, users may still claim their deal tokens from pools or convert their AELIN for a share of treasury assets.

The current plan: AELIN holders will have 6 months starting in September to claim their share of treasury tokens on the Optimism network by sending tokens to an exchangeAndBurn function on a contract we will deploy.
At the end of February, 2024 all funds that have not been claimed will be reclaimed by the Aelin Council and proportionally sent back to token holders that have claimed. In addition, any currently illiquid tokens on Arbitrum and Mainnet that have become liquid will be liquidated by the Council, bridged to Optimism, and included in the final distribution at the end of February.

To be clear, current AELIN holders only need to claim once on Optimism before the end of February. The final distribution of all unclaimed assets will be handled by the Council at the end of February to ensure maximum distribution of assets back to holders.
Since the frontend will be shutdown at the end of October, a guide to using Aelin via etherscan will be provided at https://github.com/AelinXYZ/aelin#etherscan in the case that users still need to claim their tokens after October. Finally, the discord will remain open until the end of October as well, at which point it will be deleted.
AELIN holders that exchangeAndBurn within the applicable time period are anticipated to receive roughly 66% of their current market value, based on the current market value of the treasury assets. This outcome seems much more appealing than building a new protocol with insufficient funds.

VestAMM was another major pivot for the Aelin Protocol; however, over the past few months weâ€™ve come to believe that VestAMM could not be delivered, audited, and properly brought to market with the remaining capital held by the Aelin treasury. As such, it made more sense to return value to AELIN holders as soon as it became known that VestAMM was not feasible.

It is extremely disappointing that the Aelin protocol never reached the heights we had envisioned. Aelin is 100% open source and we hope it becomes a public good for the web3 community. We are profoundly grateful for the trust and support the community placed in the project.

Even as we take this challenging step, we remain committed to the principles that guided the Aelin protocol from the beginning: transparency, innovation, and the pursuit of a more decentralized financial landscape.
