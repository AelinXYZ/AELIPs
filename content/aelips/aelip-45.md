## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Simply describe the outcome the proposed changes intends to achieve. This should be non-technical and accessible to a casual community member.-->

If passed, this AELIP will increase the duration of the Aelin Council from 3 month terms to 6 month terms.

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the proposed change, the abstract should clearly describe the proposed change. This is what *will* be done if the AELIP is implemented, not *why* it should be done or *how* it will be done. If the AELIP proposes deploying a new contract, write, "we propose to deploy a new contract that will do x".-->

This AELIP proposes to lengthen the duration of council terms for the Aelin Council to 6 month terms.

## Motivation

<!--This is the problem statement. This is the *why* of the AELIP. It should clearly explain *why* the current state of the protocol is inadequate.  It is critical that you explain *why* the change is needed, if the AELIP proposes changing how something is calculated, you must address *why* the current calculation is inaccurate or wrong. This is not the place to describe how the AELIP will address the issue!-->

Currently 3 month terms have been used which may have resulted in voter fatigue and it reduces the councilâ€™s ability to execute on their strategy over such a short time period. It is impractical to think that the best strategies will be able to be implemented within a 3 month period, much less allow time for the results of such strategies to be monitored and evaluated.

## Specification

### Overview

<!--This is a high-level overview of *how* the AELIP will solve the problem. The overview should clearly describe how the new feature will be implemented.-->

Expanding council terms from 3 months to 6 months provides a longer time horizon during which the protocol is committed to a specific vision. This will allow for greater continuity and will reduce the potential for strategic whiplash where the protocol could hypothetically move in a different direction up to 4 times a year.

### Rationale

<!--This is where you explain the reasoning behind how you propose to solve the problem. Why did you propose to implement the change in this way, what were the considerations and trade-offs. The rationale fleshes out what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->

6 months is a significant improvement in the amount of time afforded to the Aelin council to set a strategic vision and manage the execution of the strategy.

### Technical Specification

<!--The technical specification should outline the public API of the changes proposed. That is, changes to any of the interfaces Synthetix currently exposes or the creations of new ones.-->

### Test Cases

<!--Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for AELIPs but can be included with the implementation..-->
