## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Simply describe the outcome the proposed changes intends to achieve. This should be non-technical and accessible to a casual community member.-->

This AELIP proposes to pay a fixed $250 sUSD stipend to the AEGIS for their discord moderation and continued help in answering community questions.

New AEGIS’ are to be recommended and approved by the AELIN Council by simple majority vote. 


## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the proposed change, the abstract should clearly describe the proposed change. This is what *will* be done if the AELIP is implemented, not *why* it should be done or *how* it will be done. If the AELIP proposes deploying a new contract, write, "we propose to deploy a new contract that will do x".-->

The Aelin Council is instructed to distribute $250 to each AEGIS on Discord every month to their provided Ethereum address.

New AEGIS’ are to be recommended and approved by the AELIN Council by simple majority vote. 


## Motivation

<!--This is the problem statement. This is the *why* of the AELIP. It should clearly explain *why* the current state of the protocol is inadequate.  It is critical that you explain *why* the change is needed, if the AELIP proposes changing how something is calculated, you must address *why* the current calculation is inaccurate or wrong. This is not the place to describe how the AELIP will address the issue!-->

While not a protocol issue, the current framework for appointing and relying on Aegis is highly centralized and relies on trust from the Core Contributors / Admins of AELIN Discord.

This AELIP removes this centralization by relying on the recommendation and approval of any AEGIS by the Aelin Council.

Further, instead of relying on volunteers for a vital role, this AELIP proposes to pay the AEGIS’ a fixed stipend for the role that they provide.

### Overview

<!--This is a high-level overview of *how* the AELIP will solve the problem. The overview should clearly describe how the new feature will be implemented.-->

This AELIP solves this issue in two ways.

It introduces a way to decentralize the introduction of new AEGIS’ to the Discord in a fully public manner to moderate the Discord.
It rewards a valuable service to the community. Most Discords have relied on volunteers for this very useful role.

### Rationale

<!--This is where you explain the reasoning behind how you propose to solve the problem. Why did you propose to implement the change in this way, what were the considerations and trade-offs. The rationale fleshes out what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->

N/A

### Test Cases

<!--Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for AELIPs but can be included with the implementation..-->
