## Simple Summary

This Aelip proposes to completetly remove AELIP 11 and to stop payments for the Discord Aegis.

## Abstract

AELIP-11 paid each AEGIS $250 per month for their discord moderation, as of right now it isn't necessary to continue these payments due to the overall state of the market and that these moderaters have agreed to continue unpaid.

While this was a good test at the time, it isn't necessary anymmore.
