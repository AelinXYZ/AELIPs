## Simple Summary

This Aelip proposes to terminate [AELIP-11](https://aelips.aelin.xyz/aelips/aelip-11) and to stop payments for the Discord Aegis.

## Abstract

AELIP-11 paid each AEGIS $250 USD per month for their discord moderation. As of right now it isn't necessary to continue these payments due to the overall state of the market.

The moderators understand the situation and have agreed to continue unpaid.
