## Simple Summary

This AELIP proposes to deploy the AELIN factory contracts on Arbitrum.

## Abstract

Due to the growth of the Arbitrum network and the demand from more than 1 protocol to launch direct deals on Arbitrum, this AELIP proposes to deploy the Aelin factory contracts on Arbitrum.

## Motivation

Aelin is a multi-chain EVM project. The goal is to exist on every major EVM chain by slowly expanding. There have been multiple requests to deploy the contracts on Arbitrum so we are ready to move forward and deploy the factory contracts on Arbitrum.

## Specification

### Overview

Deploy the Aelin Factory contracts and update the UI to handle the Arbitrum network

### Rationale

To grow the number of networks where Aelin deals occur.

### Technical Specification

<!--The technical specification should outline the public API of the changes proposed. That is, changes to any of the interfaces Synthetix currently exposes or the creations of new ones.-->

### Test Cases

<!--Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for AELIPs but can be included with the implementation..-->
