## Simple Summary

This AELIP proposes to run a months long trial of Velodrome AMM incentivies for AELIN/ETH pools paid for in OP tokens distributed in the Phase 0 distribution. The total amount distributed will be a minimum of $3k USD per week (paid in OP), and the Aelin Council can adjust this as they see fit.



## Abstract

Due to AELIN incentivies ending for POOL 2, it is important that there is proper liquidity for Aelin on-chain. Direct incentivies have been highly capital inefficent, and have led to mercenary farming.

Incentivising LPs with OP tokens on an AMM like Velodrome will be vastly more capital efficent, because Velodrome will be matching rewards. Overall, emissions of VELO will be larger than regular token incentivies.

The total amount distributed will be a minimum of $3k USD per week (paid in OP), and the Aelin Council can adjust this as they see fit up to 8k USD per week.
