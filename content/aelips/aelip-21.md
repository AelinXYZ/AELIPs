## Simple Summary

This AELIP proposes to draft a proposal to the Optimism network for an OP token grant. Aelin Protocol has been allocated a grant of 900K OP tokens in total, pending approval of a grant proposal.

Our proposal is that OP tokens will be sold in an Aelin pool to the Optimism community at roughly the same terms as the most recent fundraising round, by our calculations this is approximately 1.10 sUSD per OP token. There will be a 1 year vesting cliff followed by a 3 year linear vesting period.

## Abstract

Users who have already bridged to Optimism tend to stay and remain active, the key is to provide sufficient utility for new users to want to bridge in the first place. This unique opportunity to participate in the OP launch will likely drive significant liquidity to be deposited onto Optimism, much of this liquidity is likely to stay as new users discover the range of protocols that are already deployed to Optimism.

In addition to being able to access OP tokens, Aelin has a pool incentive program running that will provide 2-3% AELIN rewards for all investors participating in the pool. On top of these rewards, AELIN will commit another 15 AELIN as rewards to investors participating in our first OP pool.

## Motivation

An uncapped Aelin pool targeting $990,000 worth of OP tokens at the price equivalent to the most recent fundraising round will bring liquidity to the Optimism network from investors looking to participate in the deal. This deal will motivate L1 investors to move funds for the first time to Optimism and lead to a growth of both liquidity and network utilization within a few days/weeks.
