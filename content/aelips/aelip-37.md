## Simple Summary

This AELIP proposes to decrease the Velodrome incentives to $2,000 per week. It also proposes to make this amount adjustable by the Aelin Council as they see fit.

## Abstract

Velodrome AMM has been used since [AELIP-28](https://aelips.aelin.xyz/aelips/aelip-28/). Ending incentives for Pool 2 (AELIN/ETH) could drastically decrease the liquidity for AELIN on chain. To protect investors from too much slippage whenever they are trying to buy or sell AELIN, it is essential to keep that liquidity at a sufficient level.

While it is important to keep liquidity at sufficient levels, Aelin is still paying a large amount of funds for a very highly incentivized pool of liquidity. Decreasing this to $2,000 should still create ample liquidity and rewards to those in the pool.

## Motivation

Due to the overall market condition and current situation of the Aelin Treasury, it makes the most sense to decrease these incentives until market conditions change.

## Specification

### Overview

The Aelin Council is directed to decrease rewards to $2,000 sUSD per week. Furthermore, the Aelin Council is allowed to adjust these rewards as they see fit, as they are the treasury managers.
